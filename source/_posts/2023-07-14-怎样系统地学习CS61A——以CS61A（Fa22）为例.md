## Overview[^1]

The `CS 61` series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

1. `CS 61A` concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
2. `CS 61B` deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
3. `CS 61C `focuses on machines and how they execute programs.

In `CS 61A`, we are interested in teaching you about programming, not about how to use one particular programming language. We consider a series of techniques for managing program complexity, such as functional programming and object-oriented programming.

`CS 61A` primarily uses the `Python 3` programming language. `Python` is a popular language in both industry and academia. It is also particularly well-suited to the task of exploring the topics taught in this course. It is an open-source language developed by a large volunteer community that prides itself on the diversity of its contributors.

Mastery of a particular programming language is a very useful side effect of `CS 61A`. However, our goal is not to dictate what language you use in your future endeavors. Instead, our hope is that once you have learned the concepts involved in programming, you will find that picking up a new programming language is but a few days' work. In fact, you will be asked to learn at least two other languages, `Scheme` and `SQL`, during the course.

## How to Learn

这是官方网站：

>  [CS 61A Fall 2022 (berkeley.edu)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa22/)



官方网站包含有录课视频链接，电子课本参考，以及课后练习（分为homework，lab，project，discussion【要求本校学生】四类），

建议独立完成再结合他人答案思考，下面是本人的答案，仅供参考：

其中，官网中的电子课本链接可能由于DNS解析问题无法访问，在原有的链接前添加`www.`即可，或者参照我此篇文章：

{% post_link CS61A-Reference %}



教学视频中提到的`python-tutor`可以通过以下链接访问:

> [Online Python Tutor - Composing Programs - Python 3](https://pythontutor.com/cp/composingprograms.html#mode=edit)



对于某些造成我个人困扰的问题，我也在博客中进行了单独的文章分析，包括但不限于以下篇目：



{% post_link CS61A-lab03_Analysis_Q5 %}

{% post_link CS61A-lab03_ChurchNumeral丘奇数 %}



观看教学视频需要*科学上网*，都学这专业了，大概没人不会吧（



解决了这些问题，你就可以开始在知识的海洋里遨游了，相信我，`CS61A`不会让你失望，无论是课程的深度还是相关配套设施的用心程度，都不是某些只把升职放在心上的所谓国内讲师可以比的（我也不想这么说，但现实就是这样）。其他的相关问题，网上也有许多大佬进行了解答，这里就不做赘述了
